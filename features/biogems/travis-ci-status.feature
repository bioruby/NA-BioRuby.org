Feature: Show biogem status of Travis-ci builds

  Many biogems are using travis for continuous integration testing. Biogems.info
  show the status of the *last* commit to the master branch. We would like to 
  display more information in a nice overview. First show the Rubies tested against,
  coloured by status. Also, it would be good to tie a release of the biogem (as downloadable
  from rubygems.org) with its testing results (not sure how to do that now).
