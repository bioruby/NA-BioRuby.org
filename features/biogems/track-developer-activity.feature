Feature: Track developer activity

  BioRuby is about a social network of open source software developers. The 
  site should show statistics about developer productivity, by project (biogem),
  by time (1 day, 1 week, 1,2,3,6 month, 1 year, and overall). These statistics
  should be based on git commits, and number of lines added and removed. We can
  rank developers for activity over the last week on the main BioRuby.org page.
