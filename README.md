# The website for New Age BioRuby.org

Here we work on a new state-of-the-art website for the
http://bioruby.org/ domain. This project makes use of the latest Ruby
and Coffescript coding, and integrates services, such as Twitter and
github.com.

It is a GSoC proposed project. See http://bioruby.open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code

## Features

The first step is to write features. [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)
is a great tool for turning features into tests. The features can be
found [here](https://github.com/pjotrp/NA-BioRuby.org/features).

## Finally

Clone this repo and have fun! We are on BioRuby IRC, and on the mailing list.
